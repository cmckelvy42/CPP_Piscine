this exercise doesn't need to be done as it's worth 0 points and I'm very tired atm, but the solution is using an 
overloaded function for either the lasers (mine functions for both asteroids and comets) or the mining 
targets(asteroids and comets each have a beMined function for both laser types)

just wanted to show I know how to do this simple problem to justify not spending the time on a project
that exists solely as a learning challenge
